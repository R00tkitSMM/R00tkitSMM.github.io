ImageIO is Apple's Framework that handles image parsing, which exposes 0click attack surface

Months after reading [this blog post from Google Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/04/fuzzing-imageio.html) about fuzzing ImageIO, I used LLDB to examine the testHeader functions, it turned out there are three new `testHeader` functions for different file formats.

such as `KTX2` and `WebP` and `ETC`, so because they were fairly new I thought maybe they have not been fuzzed by Project Zero.

{% highlight shell %}
1.30: where = ImageIO`IIO_Reader_KTX2::testHeader(unsigned char const*, unsigned long, __CFString const*), address = 0x00007ff8134cecc2, resolved, hit count = 5 
1.26: where = ImageIO`IIO_Reader_WebP::testHeader(unsigned char const*, unsigned long, __CFString const*), address = 0x00007ff81341f368, resolved, hit count = 0 
1.31: where = ImageIO`IIO_Reader_ETC::testHeader(unsigned char const*, unsigned long, __CFString const*), address = 0x00007ff8134dd1c6, resolved, hit count = 2
{% endhighlight %}



KTX2 is a relatively new specification introduced after the Project Zero fuzzing efforts. Arguably, its source code is also new. Further information about KTX2 can be found in its specification document here: [khronos.org](https://registry.khronos.org/KTX/specs/2.0/ktxspec_v2.html).

Although WebP has not been fuzzed by Project Zero, it is fuzzed with Google OSS-Fuzz. So I decided not to compete with Google's fuzzer in this regard.

Another important issue I noticed was that in the Project Zero's blog, ImageIO was using `OpenEXR`, but in my test, ImageIO was using Apple's closed-source new implementation of EXR in `libAppleEXR.dylib`. Therefore, I decided to fuzz these two file formats, EXR and KTX2.

the Samuel Gro√ü has modifed Honggfuzz to have a binary Coverage-guided fuzzing. but I ported Project Zero's harness to [Jackalope fuzzer](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/Jackalope) (awesome project thanks to Ivan Fratric), also I used  `initWithData` method of NSImage and in-memory fuzzing option of Jackalope to make the fuzzing faster. 

I managed to find lots of KTX2 sample files in the following pages:
- [https://github.com/donmccurdy/KTX-Parse/tree/main/test/data/reference](https://github.com/donmccurdy/KTX-Parse/tree/main/test/data/reference)
- [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software)


you can also use `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib` to increase the change of finding more bugs.  

My fuzzing effort found several vulnerabilities, you can see them in my [CVEs page](https://r00tkitsmm.github.io/fuzzing/2024/03/27/CVEs.html)
