I am a software security researcher, with expertise in hypervisors, Windows, Unix-based systems, and XNU(macOS and iOS)
you can find some of my old exploits I have written in [here](https://github.com/Rootkitsmm-zz) and [here](https://github.com/R00tkitsmm)

Some vulnerabilities I've reported include an intriguing story behind them. for example CVE-2016-0040, which you can explore in [ Microsoft's blog post]( https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2017/06/tales-from-the-msrc-from-pixels-to-poc/)

and story of a vulnerability collision with in the wild exploits in the CVE-2022-22587(iOS/macOS kernel memory corruption), media and news coverages: 
* [The Hacker News](  https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/new-actively-exploited-zero-day.html)
* [Google Project Zero 1](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/06/2022-0-day-in-wild-exploitationso-far.html)

I also became one of [the MSRCâ€™s 2020 Most Valuable Security Researchers( ranked #40)](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/announcing-2020-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/)
